2.0.0 -> 2.1.0
- added Model::GetParentBodyId()
- added Model::GetJointFrame()
- added Model::SetJointFrame()

1.X.Y -> 2.0.0
- removed Model::Init():
  All initialization is now done in the default constructor in Model(). To
	be compatible with the new API simply remove any calls to Model::Init().
- Eigen3 is no more included in RBDL instead it uses the Eigen3 library
	that is installed on the system. If you want to use RBDL with Eigen3
	you have to install it on your system yourself.
- ConstraintSet::constraint_force and ConstraintSet::constraint_impulse are
	now the forces or impulses that are acting on the constrained body by the
	constraint.
