2.2.1 -> next
- disabled clearing of joint space inertia matrix in CRBA.
  It is expected that the matrix is cleared by the user when neccessary.

2.2.1 -> 2.2.2
- adjusted default constructor for Body. It now has the identity matrix as
	inertia, instead of a zero matrix.
- LuaModel: made sure that the Body value is optional and uses the default
	Body constructor if not defined.

2.2.0 -> 2.2.1
- properly exporting LuaTables++ functions when using LuaModel addon
  Fixes linking 
- fixed exported library version (now at 2.2 as expected)

2.1.0 -> 2.2.0
- added spherical joints that do not suffer from singularities:
  Use joint type JointTypeSpherical
- added Model::q_size, and Model::qdot_size that report the sizes including
	all 4 Quaternion parameters when spherical joints are used.
	User is advised to use Model::q_size and Model::qdot_size instead of
	Model::dof_count.
- removed "constraint_" prefix from constraint impulses, forces and
	accelerations from the ConstraintSets:
	renaming required if values are queried	
- Contact impulses: specification of a contact velocity after a collision:
	added ConstraintSet::v_plus which can be set for the desired constraint
	velocity after a collision. Previously it used the values stored in 
  ConstraintSet::constraint_acceleration.
	User has to store desired exit velocities manually in CS::v_plus

2.0.1 -> 2.1.0
- made codebase compatible to Debian
	Binary symbol export was changed. No change in user code required,
	however everything needs to be recompiled and linked.
- Removed Lua 5.2 source
  When building the addon LuaModel, one hast to have it installed on the
	system already.
- Removed UnitTest++ sources
  When building tests one has to have it installed on the system already.

2.0.0 -> 2.0.1
- fixed compiler errors on some older compilers
  No change required when using RBDL version 2.0.0.
- fixed CMake configurations for examples
  No change required when using RBDL version 2.0.0.

1.X.Y -> 2.0.0
- removed Model::Init():
  All initialization is now done in the default constructor in Model(). To
	be compatible with the new API simply remove any calls to Model::Init().
- removed Eigen3 sources:
  Eigen3 is no more included in RBDL instead it uses the Eigen3 library
  that is installed on the system. If you want to use RBDL with Eigen3
  you have to install it on your system yourself.
- inverted sign of contact forces/impulses:
  ConstraintSet::constraint_force and ConstraintSet::constraint_impulse are
	now the forces or impulses that are acting on the constrained body by the
	constraint.

1.0.0 -> 1.1.0
- removed constructor Body (mass, com, length, gyration_radii)
  This constructor did some erroneous calculations to compute the real
	radii of gyration. It was removed as the two remaining constructors are
	properly tested and are more general.
