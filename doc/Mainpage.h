 *
 * This is the documentation of RBDL, the Rigid Body Dynamics Library. The
 * library contains highly efficient code for both forward and inverse
 * dynamics. It includes:
 *
 * \li Recursive Newton Euler Algorithm
 * \li Composite Rigid Body Algorithm
 * \li Articulated Body Algorithm.
 *
 * Furthermore it contains functions for forward and inverse kinematics and
 * contact handling.
 *
 * The code is written by <a
 * href="mailto:martin.felis@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de">Martin Felis
 * <martin.felis@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de></a> and heavily inspired by the
 * pseudo code of the book "Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms" of <a
 * href="http://royfeatherstone.org" target="_parent">Roy Featherstone</a>.
 * 
 * For optimal performance it is advised to use version 3 of the Eigen 
 * <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/" target="_parent">Eigen</a> math library. More
 * information about it can be found here:
 * <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/" target="_parent">http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/</a>.
 * The library must be obtained and installed separately.

 * \section recent_changes Recent Changes :
 * <ul>
 * <li>06 November 2013: New version 2.2.2: adjusted Body default constructor (inertia matrix now 3x3 identity instead of zero matrix)</li>
 * <li> 4 November 2013: New version 2.2.1: fixed exported library version</li>
 * <li> 28 October 2013: New version 2.2.0: added support for spherical joints that do not suffer from \ref joint_singularities</li>
 * <li> 29 September 2013: New version 2.1.0: adjusted build settings and symbol export to be debian compatible. Removed vendor code such as Lua 5.2 and UnitTest++. Must be pre-installed if tests or LuaModel Addon is enabled.</li>
 * <li>05 September 2013: New version 2.0.1: fixed some errors on older compilers and CMake configuration of examples. No changes required when migrating from 2.0.0.</li>
 * <li> 18. July 2013: new API version 2.0.0 for details see (\ref api_version_checking_page) </li>
 * <li> 20. February 2013: removed too specialized RigidBodyDynamics::Body constructor (API version 1.1.0)</li>
 * <li> 29. January 2013: added code for \ref api_version_checking_page. Current is 1.0.0.</li>
 * <li> 18. June 2012: added support of \ref luamodel_introduction</li>
 * <li> 01. June 2012: added support of \ref joint_models_fixed</li>
 * <li> 14. May 2012: fixed Body constructor as reported by Maxime Reis</li>
 * <li> 04. April 2012: added benchmark tool for CRBA</li>
 * <li> 01. March 2012: added multi degree of freedom \ref joint_description</li>
 * <li> 06. Februry 2012: restructured constraint handling using \ref RigidBodyDynamics::ConstraintSet</li>
 * <li> 24. January 2012: implemented compact and fast representation of \ref RigidBodyDynamics::Math::SpatialTransform </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * \section Example Examples
 *
 * A simple example for creation of a model and computation of the forward
 * dynamics using the C++ API can be found \ref SimpleExample "here".
 *
 * Another example that uses the \ref addon_luamodel_page "LuaModel Addon" can be found \ref
 * LuaModelExample "here".
 * 
 * \section ModuleOverview API reference separated by functional modules
